# Python for Biologists 2022

Welcome!
This is my repository for home tasks in the Python course at the Bioinformatics Institute. During the course, we have studied __collections__, __PEP8__, __files__, __virtual environment__, __numpy__, __pandas__, __visuaalization__, __regular expressions__, __functional programming__, __sys__, __os__, __OOP__, __decorators__, __iterators__, __web requests__, __parallel programming__, __type annotation__, __logging__.
We have worked with different libraries, including:

## Homework 1. Collections
[This tool](https://github.com/NatashaKhotkina/Python_BI_2022/tree/main/hometwork_1) can perform some basic operations with nucleic acids: 
+ __exit__ — end of program execution
+ __transcribe__ — print the transcribed sequence
+ __reverse__ — print the reversed sequence
+ __complement__ — print the complementary sequence
+ __reverse complement__ — print the reverse complementary sequence
